### Assignment

Create a circuit which uses more than one component of the Arduino Basic Kit.

#### Project: Ultrasone Distance LED Indicator

For this assignment I'm going to light up one of the 8 LED's according to the distance measured by the UltrSone Sensor.
I will use the following component:

1. Arduino Uno.
2. BreadBoard.
3. SN74HC595 8bit serial to parrallel shift register.
4. 8 x LED's.
5. 8 x 220 Ohm resistor.
6. Ultrasone Sensor.
7. Breadboard Wires.

#### Schematic

I first of all drew the circuit using TinkerCad.
