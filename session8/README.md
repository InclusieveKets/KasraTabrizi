- Introduction to Material and Design

before you can design stuff, we have to go through a design process

for solving a problem, we use a design cycle:

1. Research    uncertainty/patterns/insights
2. Concept     uncertainty/patterns/insights
3. Prototype   clarity/focus
4. Design      clarity/focus


1. Discover    Insight into the problem
2. Define      The area to focus upon
3. Developer   potential solutions
4. Deliver     solutions that work     


A design process use in Ingengo:

1. questions
2. research
3. plans
4. make
5. adjust then go to step one if not go to step 6

Make your designs Instinctive and Intuitive!!

Make something that lasts very long, not something that is replaced easily

Function Above form!

Divide the product into small problems or functions

Good Design is invisible, Bad Design is everywhere
