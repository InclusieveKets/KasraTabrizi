before you can design stuff, we have to go through a design process

for solving a problem, we use a design cycle:

1. Research    uncertainty/patterns/insights
2. Concept     uncertainty/patterns/insights
3. Prototype   clarity/focus
4. Design      clarity/focus


1. Discover    Insight into the problem
2. Define      The area to focus upon
3. Developer   potential solutions
4. Deliver     solutions that work
