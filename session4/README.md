- Using the Arduino
- Learning some simple schematics

### Basics

1. Resistor = Electrical property of a material that resist the amount of current running through it.
   Each material has a different resistor. Copper is used the most for cables, PCB routes because it is cheap.
2. Voltage = Difference in electrical potentional between two points. It can be positive and negative.
3. Current = transportation of electrical charge.
4. Power = the speed of which electrical energy moves.

### Formula

#### Ohms Law

U = I x R 
I = U / R

#### Power

P = (U x U) / R

#### Conclusion

If Voltage increases, the current increases
If the Resistance increases, the current decreases
If the Resistance increases, the voltage increases

### Tools

1. Power Supply
2. Multimeter for measuring AC/DC Voltage, Current, Resistance, etc
3. Osciloscope
4. Signal generator (Sine, square, triangle, sawtooth)


### Types of Resistors

1. Normal Static Resistor (has color bands for displaying the resistance value. Use the color codes for finding the value)
2. Potentiometer
3. LDR
4. NTC and PTC (temperature resistor)
5. Flexible Resistors

### Switches

1. Normal open / closed
2. Tactile switch
3. Multiple poles
4. SPDT (Single Pole Double Throw)

### Inductor L

A coil wrapped around a core with multiple turns of wire.
A coil always resists change. A coil stores current

### Capacitor C
A capacitor consists of two metals plates seperated by a subtrate. It will store charge.

### Relais

An electrical operated switch that works with a coil. When a voltage is applied across the coil, it will close the switch.

### Diode

A component that only lets current flow in one direction.

1. Zenerdiode (stabilisator)
2. Schotkeydiode (Lower forward voltage)
3. Photodiode (light sensitive)
4. LED (led emitting diode)

### Transistor

A component that can either be used as a switch or as an amplifier. (Current controlled)
It has three pins: base, collector and emitter

A Transistor has ...

1. Current gain HFE
2. Base Emitter Voltage
3. Collector Current

Other types of transistor:

1. MOSFET (Voltage controlled)

### Voltage Regulator

A component that converts voltage to another voltage.

### Circuits

1. Voltage Divider = uses two resistors in serie to divide the voltage.
