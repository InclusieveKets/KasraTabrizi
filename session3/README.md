### problems you get with 3D printing

1. Have support
2. Print different parts and connect them together
3. Change the orientation of the model.

### YHT rules

- When you buy 3D print, test the YHT rules to see how it behaves.

### Types of Printers

 - FDM with plastic filament
   - ABS (same material used for LEGO)
   - PLA (most commonly used and biological degradable)
     -you can use aceton on it to make the models more shiny and getting rid of the rough edges
 - SLA with uv light that hardens the liquid resin
 - SLS (powder) used for metal


 Note for FDM printers: the more you use the 3d printer to bigger the hole of the nozzle becomes. Once in a while you have to replace the nozzle with a new one.

### Assignment

- 3d print something in one piece that has mechanics in it or print something that can't made made with a lasercutter or CNC cutter
