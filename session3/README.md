## Author: Kasra Tabrizi

- Introduction to the 3D printer
- Explanantion about Tinkercad en Onshape
- Installing KiCad

### What can you print with a 3D printer

- Gadgets (small statues)
- Prototypes (gears, etc)
- Customised (pieces for oldtimers, prosthetics)

### problems you get with 3D printing

1. Have support
2. Print different parts and connect them together
3. Change the orientation of the model.

### YHT rules

- When you buy 3D print, test the YHT rules to see how it behaves. However there are models we can use to test our 3D printer out that already incorporate the YHT rules.

### Types of Printers

 - FDM with plastic filament
   - ABS (same material used for LEGO)
   - PLA (most commonly used and biological degradable)
     -you can use aceton on it to make the models more shiny and getting rid of the rough edges
 - SLA with uv light that hardens the liquid resin
 - SLS (powder) used for metal


 Note for FDM printers: the more you use the 3d printer to bigger the hole of the nozzle becomes. Once in a while you have to replace the nozzle with a new one.

### Assignment

- 3d print something in one piece that has mechanics in it or print something that can't made made with a lasercutter or CNC cutter
