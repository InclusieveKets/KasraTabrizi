process

things I learned

- first turn on lasercutter. wait untill it is loaded
- use the arrows on the lasercutter to position the laserhead
- put the board in. apply duct tape so that the board is fixed when it is hollow.
- calibrate lasercutter
- turn on laptop - open your file in inkscape
- press print and choose the right lasercutter
- a new window will open (Retina Engrave)
- connect to the lasercutter, check the IP address
- then press home
- chose the right speed and power

as the lasercutter is used; after a while the laser wattage will decrease. so the values you use from the excell are all values based on when the lasercutter was used in the beginning. it possible that you have to change the speed. for example when it is 60, you change it to 50 for cutting.

if everything is set, then press play.

### process of the smartphone stand

1. in the first version, the speed was set to 60 which didnt cut everything perfectly. I changed the speed to 50 and retried again. I couldnt slide the small piece into the larger piece because the slit was 3 mm. I took 3
mm because that is the thickness of the wood. normally you should always take a margin of 0.2mm. so I took 3.3 mm.

2. second version also wasnt good due the thickness. the thickness of the multiplex wood was actually 3.5mm. so I took 3.7mm for the width of the slit. now everything works!
